## Elden Ring Shipping Rates API

A fan made sequel.

This is a demonstration of a microservice written in Symfony that stores and retrieves shipping rates.
Rates can have maximum weight, value and region restrictions - from a variety of different couriers.

The mockup data is to do with elden ring, but it could easily be "live" data.

This would be "fed" updated shipping rates by another microservice that would handle with fetching the data from the various
external services, via whatever integrations are available, and cache them.

I've recorded a thrilling video here showing it in action (as running up a Symfony project is not always straightforward):
